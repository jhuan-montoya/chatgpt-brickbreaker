# Dependencies
This game does not have any external dependencies. It is built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Credits
This game was a test of using ChatGPT, and the code was completely generated by it. 
It took me approximately 10 minutes to generate the code and fix all the bugs, which was much faster than coding it from scratch. ChatGPT has proven to be capable of generating beginner-level codes with ease, which is very impressive.

However, I should note that when it comes to more complex models, ChatGPT struggles to deliver something truly useful. In any case, using AI to generate code has great potential for improving the efficiency and productivity of developers, and I believe we will see more and more developments in this field in the future.
